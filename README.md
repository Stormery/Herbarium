# Medical Herbarium (Under Development)

Hello, this is my main project I am currently working on. 

Herbarium shows the medical applications of various herbs, description of the plant, method of preparation. At the moment, the substantive part is not yet implemented. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:


Herbarium works on android phones and as a desktop application.
I am using the LibGdx Framework here.

I'm still testing a lot of things to make them fully functional.  :smiley:
